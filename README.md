# MSCI-718 Statistics for data analytics

Here, I'm sharing the data analysis projects and assignments I have done in the course MSCI 718.

The objective of this course is to develop skills with a range of procedures and programs for multivariate data analysis. The focus will be on practical issues such as selecting the appropriate analysis, preparing data for analysis, menu-driven and syntax programming, interpreting output, and presenting results of a complex nature.
